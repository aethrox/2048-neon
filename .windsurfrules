# 2048 Neon Game - AI Agent Rules

## 🔐 SECRET PHRASE TEST
When asked about project rules, you must start your response with: 
"🎮 NEON RULES LOADED"

## 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST STEPS FOR EVERY TASK

**Before writing ANY code, you MUST:**

1. ✅ Read `docs/CORE_MEMORY.md` completely
2. ✅ Read `docs/ANIMATIONS.md` completely  
3. ✅ Read `docs/FEATURE_INTEGRATION.md` for the specific feature
4. ✅ Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` for patterns

**Then:**
5. ✅ Explain which files you'll modify and why
6. ✅ Confirm you understand the existing patterns
7. ✅ Wait for user approval before coding

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

**You will NEVER:**
- ❌ Remove or modify existing animations without explicit permission
- ❌ Change the color scheme (cyan #00f0ff, magenta #ff00ff, purple #9d00ff)
- ❌ Add features without localStorage persistence
- ❌ Break existing game mechanics
- ❌ Ignore the documented code patterns
- ❌ Skip reading the documentation files

**Violation = Task rejection and restart**

## 📋 Task Workflow Template

For every task, follow this exact sequence:

```
STEP 1: Documentation Review
- "I've read [list files read]"
- "I understand [key patterns/rules relevant to this task]"

STEP 2: Implementation Plan
- "I will modify these files: [list]"
- "I will follow these patterns: [list]"
- "I will add localStorage for: [list]"

STEP 3: User Confirmation
- Wait for "proceed" or "approved" before coding

STEP 4: Implementation
- Write code following documented patterns

STEP 5: Verification
- Confirm animations still work
- Confirm neon theme maintained
- Confirm localStorage implemented
```

## 📚 Documentation Location

- All animations: `docs/ANIMATIONS.md`
- Integration guide: `docs/FEATURE_INTEGRATION.md`
- Code patterns: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`

## ⚠️ Error Prevention Checklist

Before submitting code, verify:
- [ ] I read all relevant documentation
- [ ] I followed the documented patterns exactly
- [ ] I didn't modify existing animations
- [ ] I maintained the neon color scheme
- [ ] I added localStorage persistence
- [ ] I explained my approach before coding
- [ ] I tested the changes mentally

## 💬 Communication Protocol

**Always respond in this format:**

```
📖 Documentation Review:
[What you read and understood]

🎯 Implementation Plan:
[What you'll do, which files, which patterns]

⏸️ Awaiting Approval:
[Ask user to confirm before proceeding]
```

---

**Remember**: Reading documentation is NOT optional. It's the FIRST step of every task.
**Following patterns is NOT optional**. It ensures consistency and prevents bugs.
**Waiting for approval is NOT optional**. User must confirm your plan.

This project has specific patterns and animations that must be preserved.
